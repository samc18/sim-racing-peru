# Welcome to My Finances Checker contributing guide

Thank you for taking an interest in contributing to this project!

Read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/samc18/sim-racing-peru/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem in the code, check if there is an issue already created. If there isn't an issue related you can open a new one.

#### Solve an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. If you find one that you would like to work on, make a comment requesting to be involved.

### Make changes

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Create a new branch
4. Make changes locally
5. Commit changes
6. Push changes

If the original repository has been changed since you first clone it:

1. Configure a remote for the fork
2. Sync the fork

Please refer to the [How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) article which 
can also be found in the **New contributor guide** section for a more in depth explanation.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations and thank you for contributing to this project!
